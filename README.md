Software engineer who enjoys jumping between domains. Over the past decade I've worked on pension systems at Deloitte, blockchain protocols at IOG, IoT platforms, mobile apps, and a few side projects in between.

Currently leading R&D for **[Ouroboros Leios](https://leios.cardano-scaling.org)** — figuring out how to make Cardano faster. Before that I architected **[Lace Wallet](https://www.lace.io/)** and somehow convinced 100+ Amazon engineers to sit through my blockchain workshops.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me on the beach volleyball court, underwater freediving, or reading something about economics or sci-fi.

## What I work with

**Day-to-day:** TypeScript, Rust, Swift, Kotlin, Python

**Areas:** Distributed systems, blockchain infrastructure, cryptography, mobile, event-driven architecture
