## SELECTED SIDE PROJECTS & CONSULTING

### **Dump it! – AI-Enhanced Note Taking App**
*Mobile & Web Development* • <span class="date">2023 - Present</span>

Built and launched cross-platform note-taking app with sophisticated AI processing pipeline and end-to-end encryption, achieving strong user retention and organic growth.

**Full-Stack Product Development:**
- Native [iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/dump-it/id6448620477) built in **Swift** with SwiftUI
- Native [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.dump.it) built in **Kotlin** with Jetpack Compose
- [Web application](https://dumpit.app) built with **React** and TypeScript
- Successfully launched on all three platforms with feature parity

**Event-Sourced Architecture:**
- Task-based async processing pipeline with specialized stages (transcribe → ingest → extract → match → resolve → execute)
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time progress streaming to client
- Immutable event stream for complete audit trail, enables undo and conflict replay
- Transactional execution with all entity operations in single database transaction
- Non-blocking client experience - immediate response with `dumpId`, processing happens in background

**Two-Phase LLM Processing Pipeline:**
- **Phase 1 - Semantic Extraction & Intent Classification:**
  - Claude Haiku analyzes user input, separates semantic units, classifies intents (create/update/delete/toggle)
  - Advanced prompt engineering with cached static sections (role, rules, examples) and dynamic context (7 recent entities, timezone)
  - Automatic time extraction: "Call mom tonight at 8pm" → todo with `remindAt` field, time stripped from text
  - Structured JSON output with validation
  - Timezone-aware date/time conversion in prompts
- **Phase 2 - Conflict Resolution:**
  - LLM resolves ambiguous cases when vector search finds multiple matches
  - Analyzes statistical context (match scores, gap analysis, reasoning) to decide execution vs. clarification
  - Semantic intent understanding: is "add milk" creating new todo or updating existing grocery list?
  - Routes to direct execution, LLM resolution, or user clarification based on match quality

**Vector Search & Adaptive Matching:**
- Sentence transformers for 768-dimensional embeddings of all notes and todos
- PostgreSQL pgvector extension with cosine similarity search (topK=8)
- **Adaptive match quality analysis** with dynamic thresholds:
  - Dynamic quality floor: `max(0.1, min(0.4, mean - stddev * 0.8))`
  - Clear winner threshold: `stddev * multiplier` (1.2 base, 1.8 for DELETE safety)
  - Gap analysis between top matches for ambiguity detection
- **Intelligent filtering**: Excludes completed todos and reminders overdue >48h
- **Recency bias**: +0.1 similarity boost for entities updated within 24 hours (balances semantic similarity with temporal relevance)
- **Routing logic**: CREATE with matches → LLM resolution, UPDATE/DELETE with clear match → direct execution, ambiguous → user clarification

**Security & Cryptography:**
- Implemented **end-to-end encryption** using **Diffie-Hellman key exchange** and **AES-256-GCM encryption**
- Utilized iOS **Secure Enclave** for cryptographic key storage and operations
- Built secure key derivation and rotation system using PBKDF2
- Zero-knowledge architecture - backend cannot access decrypted user data

**AI Integration:**
- Self-hosted **Whisper v3** model for speech-to-text transcription
- Integrated **GPT-4 API** for note summaries, translations, and content enhancement
- Leveraged AI tools (Cursor, Claude) for code generation and review across projects - **10x development velocity**
- Built intelligent note organization using embeddings and semantic similarity search

**Technical Architecture:**
- Designed **offline-first architecture** with local SQLite (mobile) and IndexedDB (web) storage
- Implemented persistent queue system for reliable cross-platform syncing
- Built conflict resolution for multi-device concurrent edit scenarios
- Created real-time sync using Server-Sent Events for instant updates across devices
