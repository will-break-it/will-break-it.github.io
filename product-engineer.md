## SIDE PROJECTS (Product Outcomes Focus)

### **Dump it! – AI Note-Taking App** • <span class="date">2023 - Present</span>
[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/dump-it/id6448620477) • [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.dump.it) • [Web](https://dumpit.app)

**Product Metrics & Growth:**
- **70% weekly retention rate** - users return consistently because product solves real problem
- **5,000+ notes created, 200+ users** within first 2 months post-launch
- Organic growth through word-of-mouth, no paid marketing
- Successfully **monetized via subscription model** with healthy conversion rate

**Intelligent UX Through AI Architecture:**
- **Non-blocking processing** - users get instant feedback, AI processes in background with real-time updates
- **Two-phase LLM pipeline** automatically understands intent: "Call mom tonight" → creates todo with reminder, no manual fields
- **Semantic search** finds relevant notes/todos by meaning, not just keywords ("almond milk" matches "get milk from store")
- **Smart conflict resolution** - system detects ambiguity and asks for clarification only when needed, not for every action
- Speech-to-text (Whisper) and AI summaries (GPT-4) that users actually use daily

**Product Development:**
- Shipped on **3 platforms simultaneously** (iOS, Android, Web) with feature parity
- Used AI tools (Cursor, Claude) to **10x development velocity** - solo shipped in 3 months
- Designed offline-first architecture so app works seamlessly without connectivity
- Event-sourced backend enables features like undo, audit history, and reliable sync

**User-Centric Engineering:**
- Implemented end-to-end encryption because privacy is core user need, not checkbox feature
- Created sync system that "just works" across devices without user configuration
- Natural language input eliminates form-filling - just dump thoughts and AI structures them
- A/B tested onboarding flows to improve activation rates

**Why this matters:** Demonstrates ability to ship complete product solo, achieve product-market fit metrics, and make sophisticated technical decisions (LLM pipeline, semantic search, event-sourcing) that create magical user experiences without exposing complexity.

## WHY PRODUCT ENGINEERING

I've consistently found the most fulfilling work at the intersection of engineering and product:

**At IOG:** Led cross-functional team shipping revenue feature while re-architecting backend for 45% faster sync (users feel the difference)
